During his tenure, Isola was elected Chairman, Conference of Local Government Council Chairmen, Ogun State. His managerial exploits during his tenure won plaudits from the then Military Administrator (MILAD) of Ogun State, Group Captain Sam Ewang.  It was also during Chief Isola's chairmanship that Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale (MKO) Abiola died on 7 July, 1998. Of great consequence was Chief Isola's decision as chairman to house and spare the lives of 29 Northerners in the local government secretariat during the rancour, acrimony, and thirst for revenge that followed the announcement of Chief Abiola's death. Isola was a victim of verbal abuse and physical intimidation from among his constituents for his show of mercy. His brief tenure as chairman ended in 1998."

            "text": "Special Assistant to the Honourable Minister (State), Finance Following Nigeria's adoption of the Fourth Republic's constitution, and introduction to a fully democratic dispensation in 1999, Alhaji Isola was appointed the Special Assistant (SPA) to the Honourable Minister of State, Finance - the late Alhaji Jubril Martins Kuye (JMK) - under the reign of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It was during this period that he attended well over a score of international seminars and conferences across the globe. He gained thorough and formal tutelage on the financial system of the United States of America in 2002 organized by the Department of State, Washington, DC, U.S.A. Isola concluded his stint as special assistant with commendation in 2003.  Secretary to the State Government, Ogun State  Following the successful election of Chief Otunba Gbenga Daniel (OGD) as governor of Ogun State in 2003 under the banner of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Sarafa Tunji Isola was appointed the Secretary to the State Government by the incumbent governor. For Hajj 2004, Alhaji Sarafa Isola led the delegation of Ogun State, Nigeria to Saudi Arabia as Amir-Hajj of Ogun State Pilgrims and recorded success and received an award for the exercise. He completed his term as the State Government's Secretary with commendation from the state governor in 2007.  Honourable Minister, Mines and Steel Development  Chief Isola was appointed the Honourable Minister for Mines and Steel Development on 26 July, 2007 by the then president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the late Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar'Adua. As of August 2007, Isola asserted that Nigeria would soon become a leader in the production of coal and bitumen. In October of the same year, during a visit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the then Indian Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, Mr. Isola met his counterpart T. Subbarami Reddy where they agreed to encourage Indian entrepreneurs in mining coal, gold, iron-ore, chrome-ore, lead, and other minerals. In June 2008, Mr. Isola received a delegation from the Chinese Mining Investment Company looking to partner in the development of seven (7) coal fields for electric power generation in Nigeria. After which, he said that a transparent and competitive process would be followed in the selection of companies for the project. On October 29, 2008, following a cabinet review by President Yar'Adua, Chief Isola was relieved of his duties as the Minister for Mines and Steel Development due to local politics.  The president released Isola from his role as Minister, albeit with commendation.  Alhaji Sarafadeen Isola did not deter in terms of his personal development following his exit from political office, he instead enrolled in a 'Leaders in Development' course in 2009 at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A.  He enrolled for a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degree at the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State and was accorded the certificate in 2011.  High Commissioner to the United Kingdom  President Muhammadu Buhari nominated 41 non-career ambassadors-designate nominees for confirmation of appointment to the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on July 1, 2020. Chief Sarafa Tunji Isola was recommended for confirmation and hearing was conducted on July 22, 2020. After a delay of six months - owing to the shock and effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on global politics and dwindling revenues to the federal government - Isola was announced as the High Commissioner to the United Kingdom on January 13, 2021."
